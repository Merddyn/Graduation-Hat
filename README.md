# Graduation-Hat

For my graduation hat I used an Arduino Mega, Dallas Temperature Sensor, 4 digit seven-segment display, and an 8x8 LED matrix to make a fun display with the current temperature and messages to anyone who was observing. Made in a few hours the night before.

The 8x8 matrix was built from this tutorial https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/SAnwandter1/programming-8x8-led-matrix-23475a. The Temperature sensor was from https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/TheGadgetBoy/ds18b20-digital-temperature-sensor-and-arduino-9cc806 and the Seven Segment display from https://www.circuitbasics.com/arduino-7-segment-display-tutorial/.

Will add a video later!
